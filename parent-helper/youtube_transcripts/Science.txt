we call all the stuff in the world matter [Music] so literally everything in our world is matter fire is matter an oven mitt is matter a truck is matter a tree is matter a bag of food is matter a chair is matter water is matter so literally anything that takes up space is matter [Music] just to remind you today we are going to talk about physical and chemical changes [Music] physical and chemical changes are two ways that matter changes and remember all the stuff in the world is matter anything that takes up spaces matters so physical and chemical changes are two ways that all the stuff around us matter changes all right so what are physical and chemical changes well physical changes are changes where the type of matter stays the same chemical changes are completely different because chemical changes are changes where the type of matter itself changes the type of matter changes with chemical change with physical change the type of matter stays the same even though it changes the type of matter stays the same [Music] so with physical changes the type of matter stays the same but with chemical changes the type of matter changes now you might say ah what does that mean what is that doing what are we doing here we're going to show you some examples and then you're going to be like oh oh my goodness i know i know the difference i know i know it i've i've learned it it's coming it's awesome physical and chemical changes it's going to be cool let's give you an example okay this is a pie this is a pie that has been baked it looks like it's an apple pie but who really knows what's inside right so this is a pie that has been baked now when it was baked was that a physical change or was that a chemical change well the outside of it turned brown and the inside was cooked so the inside changed the type of matter itself changed with the crust turning brown and the inside getting cooked so if the type of matter changed then that must be a chemical change it went through it's a chemical change now let's look at this example this is a pie that has been cut now the cutting of this pie was the cutting a physical change or a chemical change because it changed okay it was one whole pie now it's been cut has the type of matter changed because of the cutting what do you think yeah it's been a physical change because cutting doesn't change the type of matter it just changes the size of the different pieces but what the pie is made of doesn't change because of cutting so the cutting of the pie is a physical change remember with physical changes the type of matter stays the same with chemical changes the type of matter changes here we have a picture of some huge logs trees were cut down to make these logs now when the trees were cut was that a physical or a chemical change to those trees yeah a physical change because the type of matter which is the logs the wood the wood did not change the type of matter did not change it was a physical change [Music] now let's say you take some of those logs and you make a fire from it and the logs are burned in the fire the burning is that a physical or a chemical change i know you've got this which one is it yeah it's a chemical change because it's changing the type of matter the wood turns black and it can turn into ashes it changes the wood itself it's a chemical change great job here we have a picture of a metal gate that has been knocked down and it looks like it's bent maybe it got run into by something really large this gate has been broken is that a physical or a chemical change remember with physical change the type of matter doesn't change but with a chemical change it does is this a physical or chemical change this is a physical change it's knocked it down but hasn't changed the type of matter so it's a physical [Music] change look at this gate it looks all rusted the gate has been rusted have you ever seen a gate like this now the rusting [Music] is that something that's a physical or chemical change is it physical or chemical change yeah it's a chemical change because it's changed the type of matter all right here we have a picture of a little boy getting a haircut haircuts are really cool okay all right i get excited about haircuts it's true it's just something something i've got going on okay physical or chemical change is this a physical or chemical change well let's think about it the hair is cut right so it's shorter but did the type of matter change the type of matter is hair so did the hair itself change no the hair didn't change it's just shorter that means it's a physical change oh what about this oh a marshmallow roasting over a fire how great is that you know if you put the cracker in the chocolate then you got us some more really great stuff but is the change that's happening right here as this marshmallow is beginning to melt it's in the fire it's roasting is that a physical or chemical change this one might be a little easier yeah it's a chemical change the type of matter itself is changing it's darkening it's turning into something different the last example we want to give today before we finish is with ice changing into or melting into water and what kind of change is that well ice is the frozen version of water so it's still the same type of matter so when ice melts that is still considered a physical change even though the state of the matter has changed from solid to liquid it's still a physical change because it's the same type of matter [Music] well that's all for our lesson today you know we see matter every day the earth is full of stuff it's called matter and there are changes that happen physical changes which are changes that don't change the type of matter and then chemical changes which are changes that are so big actually changes the type of matter physical and chemical changes hey when is it going to be my turn i want to be in on this live stream too okay let's see i'm going to teach about pollination hi look at all these beautiful flowers that i've found let's look at some more these flowers are so pretty look at how bluey purpley they are they're just so beautiful and these ones are so red oh excuse me these ones are so red and brilliant and look at all the pretty colors it's so a chip it's so beautiful i love these flowers but all the pollen is making me sneeze and sniffly so i think we should go back inside all right that's better well flowers they make pollen and pollen is a fine powder it's usually yellow and it can make you sneeze just like me earlier flowers use pollen to make seeds through a process called pollination okay do you see these yellow feathery parts of the flower this is the male part of the flower called the stamen and that is where the pollen is made now this middle pink part of the flower is called the pistol which is the female part of the flower this is where the pollen needs to go so the flower can make seeds [Music] looking at this flower do you think the yellow parts are the stamen or the pistol [Music] that's right that's the stamen the stamen is the male part of the flower that's the part that makes pollen now here's a different flower do you think this purple part in the middle is the stamen or the pistol [Music] very good that's the pistol the pistol is the female part of the flower where the pollen needs to go so that the flower can make seeds when pollen is moved from the stamen to the pistil it is called pollination [Music] there are flowers that have both a stamen and a pistol but there are some flowers that have only a pistol and there are other flowers that have only a stamen pollen can't move by itself so how will it get to the pistol with the help of pollinators do you recognize this well-known pollinator very good that's a honeybee honeybees are pollinators and you can see the yellowy orange pollen on his leg right here pollinators are pollen helpers by moving the pollen to the pistil so the flower can make seeds let's look at some other pollinators do you know what this pollinator is called that's right this is a butterfly and this one is called a painted lady butterfly butterflies are pollinators what kind of animal is this that's right that's a bat this is a flying fox which is a fruit bat and fruit bats are pollinators too what's this little guy called great job this is a hummingbird it's a ruby throated hummingbird and hummingbirds are also pollinators other pollinators include wasps and moths ants and beetles like this ladybug are pollinators too these other pollinators are very well known they are bumblebees and honeybees all right let's review what we've learned today what is the fine yellow powder on this bee called that's right it's pollen pollen is a fine yellow powder this yellow part of the flower makes pollen do you remember what it's called that's right that's the stamen the stamen is the male part of the flower that's the part that makes pollen why do flowers use pollen great job flowers use pollen to make seeds this purple part of the flower is where the pollen needs to go so the flower can make seeds do you remember what it's called very good that's the pistol the pistol is the female part of the flower where the pollen needs to go so that the flower can make seeds what is the process called when pollen is moved from the stamen to the pistil great job when pollen is moved from the stamen to the pistol it is called pollination what is the name of the pollen helpers who move the pollen so the flower can make seeds that's right they're called pollinators pollinators are pollen helpers by moving the pollen to the pistol so the flower can make seeds now you know how the flowers around you make more flowers pollinators help them through a process called pollination so they can make seeds [Music] excuse me we're in the middle of a stream here oh it's the homophone cow what are you doing with a tablet are you using a tablet it's not for people those are for people oh well all right next let's learn about the plant parts and their functions okay so plants have six parts all right so how many plant parts are there yeah six there are six plant parts the first three help plants get water make food and grow they are roots stems and leaves the second three help plants grow new plants they are flowers fruit and seeds so let's learn the plant parts one by one first the parts that help the plant get water make food and grow okay so the first plant part we're gonna look at today are the roots roots have a special job you see roots hold the plant in the soil the soil is the dirt in the ground then roots bring water and nutrients from the soil to the plant roots are usually underground but can be above ground too have you ever seen a tree that looks like this where the roots are above ground remember the roots hold the plant to the soil okay so now we're going to look at the second part of a plant which are the stems now the stems hold the plant up above ground the stems carry water and food through the plant stems are the delivery system of the plant roots get water and nutrients from the soil and the stems carry the water and nutrients throughout the plant remember the stem holds the plant above ground the next part of the plant we're going to learn today are leaves the leaves are on the end of the stems of plants and this is interesting leaves are where plants make most of their food leaves take in air and they use air water and sunlight to make food remember leaves are on the end of the stems okay so next the parts that help the plants make new plants the next part we're going to look at are flowers flowers like leaves grow on the end of the stems flowers are often the most colorful part of the plant okay now this is awesome the rich colors of flowers help attract pollinators that's why they're beautiful the beauty has a purpose after getting pollinated flowers can make seeds and fruit do you love fruit yes fruit is awesome you have flowers to thank for that flowers make fruit so the next time you're eating an amazing piece of fruit just think to yourself ah thank you flowers thank you flowers [Music] remember flowers are the colorful growths on the stems the next part of the plant we're gonna learn about is the fruit [Music] all right now where on the plant is the fruit fruit hangs on the end of stems now you might be wondering what's the fruits job what does the fruit do well the fruits job is to hold the seeds the fruit is just a delicious seed holder [Music] now either one of two things happens to fruit fruit is either picked and eaten or it falls off the plant and rocks remember fruit is the tasty stuff on the stems [Music] okay the last part of the plant that we're going to learn today are the seeds [Music] so where are the seeds of the plant seeds hide inside of the fruit now the seeds have an incredible job you see seeds grow into new plants okay you might be wondering well how does that work well here's one way when animals eat fruit they eat the seeds later the seeds leave the animal through its waste wherever the animal is this is called dispersal or fruit falls from the tree and rots the word rots means dies the fruit dies it rots the seeds fall out and can make a new plant the first way called dispersal takes the seed to another place so it plants a new plant in a new place when a fruit falls and rots it plants a new plant nearby the original plant [Music] remember seeds live inside of the fruit hey it looked like you're doing a good job paying attention learning about the plant parts and now we want to see how much you learn [Music] we're gonna play a game called name the plant part we're gonna show you a plant part and then you go ahead and tell us which plant part it is all right hope you're ready because here we go look at this picture of a plant which plant part is colored in uh-huh the fruit the fruit of this plant great job [Music] here's the next one what plant part is colored in [Music] yeah the leaves the leaves are colored in great job [Music] all right it's time for this one it's colored brown which plant part is this [Music] uh-huh the roots awesome okay let's try this one what part of the plant is colored in do you see it there on the bottom what is that [Music] yeah what part is that yes the seeds let's try this one look at the picture could you name the plant part which plant part is that you can see it's outlined in color yeah the flowers awesome job we are so happy that you're on the live stream with us be sure and say hello in the chat or if you're watching an archived version of this video be sure and say hello in the comments we love hearing from you all right so what should we learn about next how about earthquakes and the first thing we need to understand is the earth has an outer shell isn't that interesting this outer shell is called the crust crust you know like like breadcrust and i i hope you enjoy breadcrust by the way because you can't eat the crust of the earth but i hope that you're eating the bread crust you know it's still yummy it's on the outside in fact it's really healthy it's really great okay let's get back to the crust of the year you know you don't eat the earth's crust but hopefully you eat this kind of crust okay the surface of the earth is part of this outer shell remember the outer shell is called the crust this means that hills mountains and valleys are all part of the earth's crust that means even the floor of the ocean is part of the earth's crust woohoo so what is the outer shell of the earth yeah the crust and you know it's fascinating the crust has lots of pieces and is almost like a jigsaw puzzle and you might not realize this but these pieces of crust are always moving in fact they're moving right now the pieces of crust that are below you right now are moving they're always moving now usually the crust moves slowly it doesn't move very fast when the crust moves slowly you don't feel it the pieces are moving beneath you but you don't even know because they're moving very very slowly you can't even feel it sometimes however the pieces of crust can move really fast they can move quickly when the pieces of crust are moving quickly an earthquake can happen so when the pieces of crust move slowly you don't feel it but when the pieces of crust move quickly you could have an earthquake earthquakes begin under earth's surface and shake the ground here's a picture of something that can happen when there's an earthquake do you see the massive cracks in the ground this is from an earthquake the earthquake began under the earth's surface it shook the ground and it caused this crack oh my goodness look at this picture that shows damage from an earthquake see earthquakes can also break down buildings bridges and roads they don't just cause cracks in the ground they break all kinds of things around us earthquakes are so powerful they can change earth's surface well you may be wondering where do earthquakes start earthquakes start underground at a place called the focus you can see it here on the picture that's a weird name for it i know it's called a focus we don't know why but that's just the way it is it's called the focus it's where the earthquake starts the earthquake is the strongest at the spot above the focus called the epicenter you can see from the picture it's directly above when an earthquake happens you don't want to be anywhere near the epicenter while earthquakes are very powerful they don't last that long in fact most earthquakes last less than a minute remember a minute is 60 seconds it's not too long [Music] and did you know this earthquake fact earthquakes get scored by how strong they are that's pretty neat earthquakes get their own score their own number scientists use seismographs to measure and score earthquakes the bigger the number the stronger the earthquake [Music] so here are some common earthquake scores a one or two earthquake you barely feel it the three to six range of earthquakes they're gonna be some damage but seven plus any number that's seven or higher for an earthquake score that's a massive earthquake and there's going to be tons of damage [Music] remember the earth has an outer shell and this outer shell is called the crust the crust has lots of pieces and is almost like a jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces are always moving but if they move too fast that can cause an earthquake and an earthquake changes the earth's surface and can damage roads bridges buildings and even crack up the earth [Music] and remember the earthquake is the strongest at the spot above the focus called the epicenter you don't want to be anywhere near the epicenter if an earthquake was to happen thanks for learning about earthquakes with us a powerful way that earth's surface changes that was awesome how are you doing you're live streaming homeschool pop or you're watching one of the archived versions of the live stream that's really cool you're learning you're doing great hmm what to learn about next how about the planets of the solar system now as we begin we have to answer this question what are planets huh this is a really good question what are planets planets are round objects that orbit the sun here is a picture of the sun it's the largest star in our solar system it's massive and you can see there's a ring around it those are some solar flares fire shooting out of the sun absolutely amazing and stunning and it kind of looks like a pizza actually i'm just kind of just feeling creative doesn't look like a cheese pizza [Music] the word orbit means to circle around that means planets around objects that circle around the sun hey what 3d shape is a planet think about it what 3d shape is a planet we know that a planet is round what 3d shape is perfectly round yeah a sphere yeah planets are spheres they're perfectly round good job to summarize planets are spheres that go around the sun pretty simple huh hey did you know there are two types of planets yeah it's really interesting there are two types of planets okay so there are primary planets and there are dwarf planets those are the two types of planets now there are eight primary planets these are the main planets that you think of the main planets that are circling around the sun and these are the planets we're going to be studying in this video and then there are five dwarf planets these planets are a lot smaller and are not considered primary planets sorry pluto wow there they are the primary planets you're gonna get to know all eight of these primary planets you're gonna know them so well oh my goodness this is gonna be awesome the first planet is mercury mercury is the closest planet to the sun the second planet is venus pretty cool huh the second planet is venus our planet earth is the third planet from the sun the fourth planet is mars mars is the fourth planet the fifth planet is jupiter that's the biggest planet of them all the sixth planet is saturn you gotta love those rings saturn is the sixth planet uranus is the seventh planet and the eighth planet is neptune neptune is the furthest primary planet from the sun let's look at each of the eight primary planets the first planet is mercury [Music] here's where mercury is it is the closest planet to the sun okay the sun is super duper hot so guess what mercury is a really really hot planet in fact mercury is four times hotter than boiling water have you ever seen boiling water it's so hot it's boiling it can cook things it's really really hot if you barely touch it you will hurt yourself so bad well mercury is four times hotter than that oh my goodness it is a very hot planet four times hotter than boiling water mercury is one of the rocky planets there are four rocky planets and mercury is one of them oh and mercury it is the smallest primary planet mercury is so much smaller than the other planets tiny little a little baby mercury it's the smallest planet of the primary planet so if you think a small planet think of mercury it's small it's hot you wouldn't want to live there the next planet planet two is venus venus is right here it's the second planet from the sun now this is interesting venus is called earth's twin the reason for that is they are very similar size they're almost the same size and what's interesting they're both rocky planets just like mercury is and earth and venus are made of similar rocks so they're pretty much the same size very similar size and they're made of the same stuff it's almost like the earth and the planet venus are twins hey did you know every day on venus is a cloudy day and the clouds are yellow oh that's such a gross color for clouds clouds are much better when there are other colors than yellow so the sunlight doesn't actually hit the surface of venus it's just a cloudy day every day forever but that's okay because there's no life on venus so nobody's crying about it and this is cool venus is the closest planet to earth [Music] it is the easiest planet to see in the sky you don't even need a telescope how cool is that [Music] the third planet is well ours the earth the earth is the third planet here's where the earth is yep it's the third planet from the sun by the way these planets never line up like this we just have it like this so you can see the order of the planets but they're normally very very jumbled they don't line up like this just wanted to share that but the earth is the third planet from the sun here's a picture of the ocean and some seagulls that are in some of the shallow parts of the water it's interesting earth is the only planet we know of that has oceans and life on it earth is one of the rocky planets yeah we live on a massive rock that has oceans that has life i mean that's absolutely incredible remember four of the planets are rocky planets earth has one moon the moon orbits the earth like the earth orbits the sun wow there's our planet that's where we live the earth the fourth planet is mars mars is right here in between earth and jupiter what color is mars look at mars what color is that yeah it's kind of like a reddish orange because of its color mars is called the red planet so if anyone asks you what's the red planet tell them hey the red planet is mars even though it is red it is not hot it is much colder than earth because remember mars is further from the sun than the earth so mars it's red it almost looks like it would be hot but it's cold [Music] hey is there life on mars that's a really good question that a lot of scientists have been trying to answer for a long time well scientists believe there used to be water on mars if there was water there may have been life and even stranger there are some scientists that believe we may still find basic forms of life still living on mars mars is the fourth rocky planet remember we said there are only four rocky planets so it's the last of the rocky planets mars has volcanoes and valleys just like earth they're just sometimes much bigger in fact there's a volcano on mars that's as big as the state of texas wow huge and this is kind of cool mars has two moons they are both very small okay they're small moons which is good you know mars has a couple moons it's nice we've got a moon mars has two moons you know mars is the fourth planet from the sun and it's in between the earth and jupiter the fifth planet is jupiter jupiter the first of the gas planets here is where jupiter is it's the massive planet between mars and saturn i mean jupiter is huge it's the biggest planet in our solar system in fact all of the other planets could fit in jupiter and there would be extra room all of the other planets could fit inside of jupiter that's how big jupiter is and this is amazing jupiter has at least 63 moons and we say at least because they're still discovering more wow and because jupiter is a gas planet if you ever visited it you would just fall right through just kidding you would float i mean you they wouldn't fall the gravity wouldn't be there you would just kind of float around and you know jupiter is the giant gas planet in between mars and saturn the sixth planet is saturn another gas planet here is saturn the sixth planet from the sun you could spot it easily because of those huge rings and it's in between jupiter and uranus hey did you know saturn's rings are made of ice oh my goodness how cool that must be oh i see rings those rings are made of ice wow like jupiter saturn has a lot of moons saturn has 62 moons wow tons and tons of moons what's up with jupiter and saturn right and this is pretty awesome saturn is the farthest planet you can see without a telescope that's right you can see saturn with your own eyes without a telescope look mommy and daddy i see shading with my own eyes and shadow and i see the rings and everything saturn is a gas planet that's the sixth planet from the sun and is in between jupiter and uranus the seventh planet is uranus another gas planet uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is in between saturn and neptune both uranus and neptune are the only planets you can't see without a telescope so it took a while for them to be discovered now this is neat william herschel discovered uranus in 1781 it took us a long time to finally find the planet uranus uranus is a gas planet that is made of gas and liquid what's cool is uranus has rings just like saturn has rings scientists believe the rings of uranus could be pieces of broken moons we don't know for sure but that's really fascinating if that's the case speaking of moons uranus has 27 moons 27 moons i mean we just have one 27. uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is in between saturn and neptune the eighth and final planet is neptune hey that means the first four planets are rocky planets and the last four planets are gas planets so here is where neptune is it's the furthest planet from the sun like uranus neptune is a gas planet that is also made of liquid neptune was discovered in 1846 when uranus was being studied they're like wait a second there's a whole other planet here on the end let's call it neptune neptune is known for its storms the worst storms in the solar system in fact winds reach over 1 000 miles per hour on neptune that's pretty intense neptune has 14 known moons but scientists believe there may be more here's neptune the furthest planet from the sun you have done such an amazing job with us today today we learned planets are round objects that orbit the sun the word orbit means to circle around basically the planets are round objects that go around the sun we learn there are two types of planets primary planets and there are eight primary planets and dwarf planets there are five dwarf planets and here are all eight primary planets they're familiar friends now mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune the first four planets are rocky planets mercury venus earth and mars are rocky planets the four planets furthest from the sun are the gas planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune are gas planets oh is that a bear sleeping at the beach because guess what he should wake up because we're still in the middle of our live stream we're still learning here we're still learning why is he sleeping it's time to learn in fact next we are going to talk about the human brain doesn't that sound cool and intriguing and maybe a little bit gross well it's gonna be a lot of fun because the brain is an amazing amazing part of your body and you're gonna understand it after watching his video i know we're gonna jump right in it's gonna be so cool so what is a brain i mean here in this drawing it almost looks like it's like bubble gum what is a brain well the brain is an organ of the body isn't that interesting it's an organ of the body [Music] all right so what is an organ we have to know that to know what a brain is if the brain is an organ of the body what is an organ it's interesting an organ is a special group of tissues that do specific jobs for your body [Music] like your heart your heart is a special group of tissues that does a specific job for your body and eyeball is an organ too it's a special group of tissues that does a specific job for your body and how about a kidney a kidney is an organ that's a special group of tissues that does a specific job for your body see the brain isn't like just some wad of gums the brain is a special group of tissues and not only that remember an organ is a special group of tissues that do specific jobs for your body they do different jobs they have tasks to do so we know there are special tasks that the brain has to do but what does the brain do what is it that the brain does well this might sound crazy okay this might i hope you're sitting down this might sound a little crazy the brain controls most of the activities of the body your brain is like the control center of your body when you sit down your brain told your body to sit down when you stand up your brain told your body to stand up it's amazing your brain controls most of the activities of your body wait what what's with this sad music i mean this is not a sad thing the brain controls most of the activities of the body but that's a that's a good thing who's playing this sad music right now seriously kittens two kittens playing the piano are you kidding me are you they're cute but come on all right tell them if they're gonna play piano tell them to play the right kind of music okay it's not much to ask tell them to play the right kind of music all right that's better so the brain controls most of the activities of the body and that's a really good thing you see the brain is really powerful oh my goodness the brain is really really really really powerful it does a great job of controlling the activities of your body your brain is a champ it's like the control center of your body and your brain does a phenomenal job wait but how does something that almost looks like a wad of bubble gum control most of the activities of your body how does that even work well your brain uses something called the nervous system yeah the nervous system [Music] it's different than this kind of nervous this man his team is behind okay it's near the end of the game he doesn't know if they're going to be able to win he's sitting there wearing his cape he's nervous this is a different type of nervous the nervous system is how the brain is able to control the actions of your body and here's how it works here is where your brain is and here is where something called the spinal cord is now the brain and the spinal cord work together to send information called signals these signals are sent to what are called your nerves your nerves enable your body to do what your brain directed and that is how the brain is able to control most of the actions of your body the brain and spinal cord make up what's called the central nervous system where information is processed and sent out as signals and those nerves that go throughout your whole body those are called the peripheral nervous system these arrows are just pointing to just a few that are in the arm but they go all over the place and they receive these signals from the brain how cool is that from the central nervous system the brain and spinal cord the peripheral nervous system gets the signals and is like okay let's do this and what's so cool it can work the other way around where the nerves can actually send signals to the spinal cord and to the brain [Music] let's say you're playing outside and you fall and you hurt your knee your nerves which are part of the peripheral nervous system send out a signal and say uh oh uh oh pain i'm hurt i'm hurt in the knee [Music] that signal gets sent to the brain and spinal cord which are the central nervous system and your brain processes that information so you can take the action that you need to take which is to take care of your name hey did you know the brain because it controls most of the activities of your body needs to be protected [Music] that is why it's so amazing that your brain lives here in something called the skull your brain lives in the skull your skull is really hard and protects your brain because your brain controls most of the activities of your body but not only that [Music] the brain is also responsible for all of your thinking and dreaming and imagining have you ever sat down and just thought and planned all of that is using your brain how incredible so good that your brain lives in your skull so it can be protected because not only does it control most of the activities of your body but also you do your thinking with your brain you're imagining with your brain even you're dreaming with your brain how incredible is the human brain and if you want to know a secret you were using your brain the whole time you're watching this video as you were learning you're using your brain how cool is that we love the brain the brain is so so awesome we are so happy to have you with us i mean you are so awesome you really are oh you like my poster mr whiskers poster you know it's pretty cool pretty cool you know it's a pretty cool poster pretty cool cat too i wonder what he would like to learn about next if he would learn from one of our videos what would he like to learn next how about [Music] let's learn about reptiles this is amazing this is awesome you know the world has many different types of animals one of the most fascinating types are the reptiles and you're about to see why but first let's meet some of these reptiles snakes turtles crocodiles geckos lizards and chameleons now look at these incredible animals they're all reptiles what do they all have in common we're about to find out what makes all these animals reptiles first of all they are covered with scales not with hair or feathers but with scales [Music] look at this incredible iguana oh my goodness covered in scales i mean just look at these scales these scales are dry and they're waterproof and they cover the bodies of reptiles just like this iguana reptiles aren't covered in fur they're not covered in hair they're not covered in feathers they're covered in these waterproof scales look at this massive snake you can see that the snake is covered with scales remember snakes are reptiles and reptiles are covered with scales look at all these scales absolutely covered with these intricate scales here's an interesting example of scales this is an albino alligator which means the alligator is very pale and you can see that this alligator is covered with scales but the alligator also has these bony plates on his back you can kind of see them there in the corner those are not scales but reptiles also can have those bony plates but this alligator is still covered with scales scales are a big clue that an animal is a reptile the second thing you need to know about reptiles is reptiles breathe in oxygen just like we breathe in oxygen reptiles have to breathe in oxygen to survive now just like people reptiles have two lungs in their body lungs bring in new air and pump out the old air even reptiles that live in and near water like crocodiles and alligators have to breathe in air to survive now this is so fascinating did you know reptiles are cold blooded cold blooded means that their bodies don't keep them warm automatically they have to have sunlight to keep them warm here's a picture of a lizard that's soaking in some sunlight this is very important for this lizard because as with all the other reptiles this lizard is cold blooded that means that the temperature of the lizard needs to have sunlight to keep it warm it doesn't warm automatically this lizard is cold blooded here's a snake that's in the sunlight the sunlight is helping to warm the body of this snake this doesn't happen automatically with the snake's body because the snake is cold-blooded just like the other reptiles [Music] hey here's a picture of a chameleon chameleons are just so cool now of course this chameleon is cold blooded because all the reptiles are cold-blooded if they want to get warmer they have to go to the sunlight because their bodies don't warm them they're cold-blooded [Music] wow i mean right i mean these are incredible creatures you know reptiles they're covered in these dry waterproof scales they breathe in oxygen with those two lungs like we do they're cold blooded which is so fascinating can you imagine having to lay out in the sun if you wanted to warm your body instead of your body being able to do it on its own these are fascinating creatures [Music] hey do you have a favorite reptile [Music] it's okay you don't have to tell me but [Music] cool very cool yeah it's you know you figure snakes turtles crocodiles alligators geckos lizards chameleons mean reptiles are just the coolest aren't they they're just absolutely amazing wow mom you're doing such a great job in your race i had no idea you were an athlete okay i mean with all that cloth wrapped around you're doing great you're doing a great job just like these kids are doing a great job learning in fact how about this the next thing we're gonna learn about is the human heart the different parts of your heart how it works how it functions we're gonna have such a great time okay well let's start here what is the heart that's a great question what is the heart well the heart is an organ of your body yeah that's right the heart is an organ of your body okay so what is an organ yeah we have to know that to know what a heart is if the heart is an organ of the body what is an organ it's interesting an organ is a special group of tissues that do specific jobs for your body like your brain your brain is an organ it's a special group of tissues that does a specific job for your body an eyeball is an organ too it's a special group of tissues that does a specific job for your body [Music] and how about a kidney a kidney is an organ that's a special group of tissues that does a specific job for your body so we know the heart is a special group of tissues don't we because it's an organ and an organ is a special group of tissues but that's not all remember an organ is a special group of tissues that do specific jobs for your body they do different jobs they have tasks to do so what does the heart do well we can see it's moving isn't it the heart is constantly moving wow so what does the heart do for your body that is a really good question why am i asking you that question why am i not just telling you the answer all right let's tell you well here it is the heart pumps blood through the body that amazing the heart pumps blood through the body your heart is a big pump and it's pumping blood through your body as you're watching this video right now you're watching homeschool pop you're having a great time and even right now your heart is pumping blood through your body isn't that incredible so how does your heart do that and why am i in a grocery store i guess i'm hungry for fish again [Music] so the heart has four chambers four chambers if anyone ever asks you how many chambers does your heart have you'll say my heart has four chambers that word chamber almost means like a room it's almost like your heart has four rooms it has four chambers there's the right atrium and there's the left atrium these are the top chambers of your heart [Music] then the lower two chambers are the right ventricle and the left ventricle pretty simple the heart has four chambers two on the top two on the bottom so here is how the heart pumps blood through the body the blood comes in through these valves right here into the right atrium and the left atrium do you see those arrows the blood flows in then the blood goes into the ventricles the right ventricle and the left ventricle isn't that pretty cool [Music] then the blood leaves the ventricles through these valves up here and it's ready to replenish the body with the oxygen and nutrients that your body needs this is all made possible because the heart is a muscular organ meaning it has lots of muscles those muscles are what enables it to pump blood through your body isn't that cool it's such a strong organ the heart pumps blood to every part of your body through the veins and arteries [Music] this is called the circulatory system isn't that amazing it enables your entire body to get the oxygen and nutrients that it needs so you can be healthy and strong the heart what an amazing organ that pumps blood through your body so you can stay strong and healthy hey when is it going to be my turn i want to be in on this live stream too okay let's see i'm going to teach about amphibians so i thought i would come out here and go for a walk to try to find some amphibians oh i see something up ahead what is this look at this little cutie coming our way what it's not an amphibian it's a cat oh okay let's go to the classroom some examples of amphibians are frogs salamanders toads and newts which are a type of salamander so what makes amphibians amphibian well they have moist skin and they start their life in water the word amphibian means two lives because they live the first part of their life in the water and the second part on land are born with gills and fins to help them breathe and swim in the water then something really cool happens as they grow [Music] they go through a change called metamorphosis and grow lungs and legs to breathe air and walk on land there's another creature we know of that goes through metamorphosis do you remember what it is that's right it's butterflies they change from caterpillars into butterflies and become a different creature just like the amphibians amphibians like to live in wet areas like forests swamps ponds and rain forests they eat water fleas beetles slugs and larvae which are baby insects and sometimes they even eat each other get ready for review game time we're gonna figure out which of these next few things have to do with amphibians and which ones do not our first question is is that an amphibian i'll show you a picture and you tell me if it's an amphibian or not is this an amphibian yes that's an amphibian it's called a frog how about this one good job that's not an amphibian it's a bird now let's try this one yes that is an amphibian it's a salamander is this an amphibian that's right that is an amphibian it's a newt which is a type of salamander how about this one oh wait a minute that's mr whiskers mr whiskers what are you doing here did you know this was a game it's only a game don't worry we don't think you're an amphibian right guys see we don't think you're an amphibian this last part of the game is called is this a good home we're gonna pick what the right homes for an amphibian will be does this look like a good place for an amphibian to live [Music] good job that's right amphibians don't live in the desert it's too dry there does this look like a good home [Music] you're right this is not a good home for amphibians it's too cold here how about this place yay that's right this is a perfect place for amphibians to live they love ponds great job the two big things we learned today are that amphibians have moist skin and they start their life in water well you did it you learned all about amphibians today and you did a great job thank you so much for joining me and i look forward to seeing you next time bye bye [Music] you are watching homeschool pop live the world is full of stuff right and in science we call all the stuff in the world matter so literally everything in our world is matter fire is matter an oven mitt is matter a truck is matter a tree is matter a bag of food is matter a chair is matter waters matter so literally anything that takes up space is matter [Music] just to remind you today we are going to talk about physical and chemical changes [Music] physical and chemical changes are two ways that matter changes and remember all the stuff in the world is matter anything that takes up spaces matters so physical and chemical changes are two ways that all the stuff around us matter changes alright so what are physical and chemical changes well physical changes are changes where the type of matter stays the same chemical changes are completely different because chemical changes are changes where the type of matter itself changes the type of matter changes with chemical change with physical change the type of matter stays the same even though it changes the type of matter stays the same [Music] so with physical changes the type of matter stays the same but with chemical changes the type of matter changes now you might say ah what does that mean what is that doing what are we doing here we're going to show you some examples and then you're going to be like oh my goodness i know i know the difference i know i know it i've learned it it's coming it's awesome physical and chemical changes it's gonna be cool [Music] let's give you an example okay this is a pie this is a pie that has been baked it looks like it's an apple pie but who really knows what's inside right so this is a pie that has been baked now when it was baked was that a physical change or was that a chemical change well the outside of it turned brown and the inside was cooked so the inside changed the type of matter itself changed with the crust turning brown and the inside getting cooked so if the type of matter changed then that must be a chemical change it went through it's a chemical change now let's look at this example this is a pie that has been cut now the cutting of this pie was the cutting a physical change or a chemical change because it changed okay it was one whole pie now it's been cut has the type of matter changed because of the cutting what do you think yeah it's been a physical change because cutting doesn't change the type of matter it just changes the size of the different pieces but what the pie is made of doesn't change because of cutting so the cutting of the pie is a physical change remember with physical changes the type of matter stays the same with chemical changes the type of matter changes here we have a picture of some huge logs trees were cut down to make these logs now when the trees were cut was that a physical or a chemical change to those trees yeah a physical change because the type of matter which is the logs the wood the wood did not change the type of matter did not change it was a physical change [Music] now let's say you take some of those logs and you make a fire from it and the logs are burned in the fire the burning is that a physical or a chemical change i know you've got this which one is it yeah it's a chemical change because it's changing the type of matter the wood turns black and it can turn into ashes it changes the wood itself it's a chemical change great job [Music] here we have a picture of a metal gate that has been knocked down and it looks like it's bent maybe it got run into by something really large this gate has been broken is that a physical or a chemical change remember with physical change the type of matter doesn't change but with a chemical change it does is this a physical or chemical change this is a physical change it's knocked it down but hasn't changed the type of matter so it's a physical change [Music] look at this gate it looks all rusted the gate has been rusted have you ever seen a gate like this now the rusting [Music] is that something that's a physical or chemical change is it physical or chemical chain yeah it's a chemical change because it's changed the type of matter all right here we have a picture of a little boy getting a haircut haircuts are really cool okay all right i get excited about haircuts it's true it's just something something that i've got going on okay physical or chemical change is this a physical or chemical change well let's think about it the hair is cut right so it's shorter but did the type of matter change the type of matter is hair so did the hair itself change no the hair didn't change it's just shorter that means it's a physical change [Music] oh what about this oh marshmallow roasting over a fire how great is that you know if you put the cracker in the chocolate then you got us some more really great stuff but is the change that's happening right here as this marshmallow is beginning to melt it's in the fire it's roasting is that a physical or chemical change this one might be a little easier yeah it's a chemical change the type of matter itself is changing it's darkening it's turning into something different [Music] the last example we want to give today before we finish is with ice changing into or melting into water and what kind of change is that well ice is the frozen version of water so it's still the same type of matter so when ice melts that is still considered a physical change even though the state of the matter has changed from solid to liquid it's still a physical change because it's the same type of matter [Music] well that's all for our lesson today you know we see matter every day the earth is full of stuff it's called matter and there are changes that happen physical changes which are changes that don't change the type of matter and then chemical changes which are changes that are so big actually changes the type of matter physical and chemical changes we are so happy that you're on the live stream with us be sure and say hello in the chat or if you're watching an archived version of this video be sure and say hello in the comments we love hearing from you alright so what should we learn about next how about the plank parts and their functions okay so plants have six parts all right so how many plant parts are there yeah six there are six plant parts the first three help plants get water make food and grow they are roots stems and leaves the second three help plants grow new plants they are flowers fruit and seeds so let's learn the plant parts one by one first the parts that help the plant get water make food and grow okay so the first plant part we're going to look at today are the roots roots have a special job you see roots hold the plant in the soil the soil is the dirt in the ground then roots bring water and nutrients from the soil to the plant roots are usually underground but can be above ground too have you ever seen a tree that looks like this where the roots are above ground remember the roots hold the plant to the soil okay so now we're going to look at the second part of a plant which are the stems now the stems hold the plant up above ground the stems carry water and food through the plant stems are the delivery system of the plant roots get water and nutrients from the soil and the stems carry the water and nutrients throughout the plant remember the stem holds the plants above ground the next part of the plant we're going to learn today are leaves the leaves are on the end of the stems of plants and this is interesting leaves are where plants make most of their food leaves take in air and they use air water and sunlight to make food remember leaves are on the end of the stems okay so next the parts that help the plant make new plants next part we're going to look at are flowers flowers like leaves grow on the end of the stems flowers are often the most colorful part of the plant okay now this is awesome the rich colors of flowers help attract pollinators that's why they're beautiful the beauty has a purpose after getting pollinated flowers can make seeds and fruit do you love fruit yes fruit is awesome you have flowers to thank for that flowers make fruits so the next time you're eating an amazing piece of fruit just think to yourself thank you flowers thank you flowers [Music] remember flowers are the colorful growths on the stems the next part of the plant we're going to learn about is the fruit [Music] all right now where on the plant is the fruit fruit hangs on the end of stems now you might be wondering what's the fruits job what does the fruit do well the fruits job is to hold the seeds the fruit is just a delicious seed holder [Music] now either one of two things happens to fruit fruit is either picked and eaten or it falls off the plant and rocks remember fruit is the tasty stuff on the stems [Music] okay the last part of the plant that we're gonna learn today are the seeds [Music] so where are the seeds of the plant seeds hide inside of the fruit now the seeds have an incredible job you see seeds grow into new plants okay you might be wondering well how does that work well here's one way when animals eat fruit they eat the seeds later the seeds leave the animal through its waste wherever the animal is this is called dispersal or fruit falls from the tree and rots the word rots means dies the fruit dies it rots the seeds fall out and can make a new plant the first way called dispersal takes the seed to another place so it plants a new plant in a new place when a fruit falls and rots it plants a new plant nearby the original plant [Music] remember seeds live inside of the fruit [Music] hey it looked like you're doing a good job paying attention learning about the plant parts and now we want to see how much you learn [Music] we're gonna play a game called name the plant part we're gonna show you a plant part and then you go ahead and tell us which plant part it is all right hope you're ready because here we go look at this picture of a plant which plant part is colored in uh-huh the fruit the fruit of this plant great job [Music] here's the next one what plant part is colored in [Music] yeah the leaves the leaves are colored in great job [Music] all right it's time for this one it's colored brown which plant part is this [Music] uh-huh the roots awesome okay let's try this one what part of the plant is colored in do you see it there on the bottom what is that [Music] yeah what part is that yes the seeds let's try this one look at the picture could you name the plant part which plant part is that you can see it's outlined in color yeah the flowers awesome job excuse me we're in the middle of a stream here oh it's the homophone cow what are you doing with a tablet are you using a tablet it's not for people those are for people oh well all right next let's learn about earthquakes and the first thing we need to understand is the earth has an outer shell isn't that interesting this outer shell is called the crust crust you know like you know like breadcrust and i i hope you enjoy breadcrust by the way because you can't eat the crust of the earth but i hope that you're eating the bread crust you know it's still yummy it's on the outside in fact it's really healthy it's really great okay let's get back to the crust of the earth you know you don't eat the earth's crust but hopefully you eat this kind of crust okay the surface of the earth is part of this outer shell remember the outer shell is called the crust this means that hills mountains and valleys are all part of the earth's crust that means even the floor of the ocean is part of the earth's crust so what is the outer shell of the earth yeah the crust and you know it's fascinating the crust has lots of pieces and is almost like a jigsaw puzzle and you might not realize this but these pieces of crust are always moving in fact they're moving right now the pieces of crust that are below you right now are moving they're always moving now usually the crust moves slowly it doesn't move very fast when the crust moves slowly you don't feel it the pieces are moving beneath you but you don't even know because they're moving very very slowly you can't even feel it sometimes however the pieces of crust can move really fast they can move quickly when the pieces of crust are moving quickly an earthquake can happen so when the pieces of crust move slowly you don't feel it but when the pieces of crust move quickly you could have an earthquake earthquakes begin under earth's surface and shake the ground here's a picture of something that can happen when there's an earthquake do you see the massive cracks in the ground this is from an earthquake the earthquake began under the earth's surface and shook the ground and it caused this crack oh my goodness look at this picture that shows damage from an earthquake see earthquakes can also break down buildings bridges and roads they don't just cause cracks in the ground they break all kinds of things around us earthquakes are so powerful they can change earth's surface well you may be wondering where do earthquakes start earthquakes start underground at a place called the focus you could see it here on the picture that's a weird name for it i know it's called a focus we don't know why but that's just the way it is it's called the focus it's where the earthquake starts the earthquake is the strongest at the spot above the focus called the epicenter you can see from the picture it's directly above when an earthquake happens you don't want to be anywhere near the epicenter [Music] while earthquakes are very powerful they don't last that long in fact most earthquakes last less than a minute remember a minute is 60 seconds it's not too long [Music] and did you know this earthquake fact earthquakes get scored by how strong they are that's pretty neat earthquakes get their own score their own number scientists use seismographs to measure and score earthquakes the bigger the number the stronger the earthquake [Music] so here are some common earthquake scores a one or a two earthquake you barely feel it the three to six range of earthquakes they're going to be some damage but seven plus any number that's seven or higher for an earthquake score that's a massive earthquake and there's going to be tons of damage [Music] remember the earth has an outer shell and this outer shell is called the crust the crust has lots of pieces and is almost like a jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces are always moving but if they move too fast that can cause an earthquake and an earthquake changes the earth's surface and can damage roads bridges buildings and even crack up the earth and remember the earthquake is the strongest at the spa above the focus called the epicenter you don't want to be anywhere near the epicenter if an earthquake was to happen thanks for learning about earthquakes with us a powerful way that earth's surface changes oh is that a bear sleeping at the beach because guess what he should wake up because we're still in the middle of our live stream we're still learning here we're still learning why is he sleeping it's time to learn in fact next we are going to talk about the planets of the solar system [Applause] now as we begin we have to answer this question what are planets huh it's a really good question what are planets planets are round objects that orbit the sun here is a picture of the sun it's the largest star in our solar system it's massive and you can see there's a ring around it those are some solar flares fire shooting out of the sun absolutely amazing and stunning and it kind of looks like a pizza actually i just kind of just feel like then they look like a cheese pizza looks really yummy the word orbit means to circle around that means planets around objects that circle around the sun hey what 3d shape is a planet think about it what 3d shape is a planet we know that a planet is round what 3d shape is perfectly round yeah a sphere yeah planets are spheres they're perfectly round good job to summarize planets are spheres that go around the sun pretty simple huh hey did you know there are two types of planets it's really interesting there are two types of planets okay so there are primary planets and there are dwarf planets those are the two types of planets now there are eight primary planets these are the main planets that you think of the main planets that are circling around the sun and these are the planets we're going to be studying in this video and then there are five dwarf planets these planets are a lot smaller and are not considered primary planets sorry pluto well there they are the primary planets you're gonna get to know all eight of these primary planets you're gonna know them so well oh my goodness this is gonna be awesome the first planet is mercury mercury is the closest planet to the sun the second planet is venus pretty cool huh the second planet is venus our planet earth is the third planet from the sun the fourth planet is mars mars is the fourth planet the fifth planet is jupiter that's the biggest planet of them all [Music] the sixth planet is saturn you gotta love those rings saturn is the sixth planet uranus is the seventh planet and the eighth planet is neptune neptune is the furthest primary planet from the sun let's look at each of the eight primary planets the first planet is mercury [Music] here's where mercury is it is the closest planet to the sun okay the sun is super duper hot so guess what mercury is a really really hot planet in fact mercury is four times hotter than boiling water have you ever seen boiling water it's so hot it's boiling it can cook things it's really really hot if you barely touch it you will hurt yourself so bad well mercury is four times hotter than that oh my goodness it is a very hot planet four times hotter than boiling water mercury is one of the rocky planets there are four rocky planets and mercury is one of them oh and mercury it is the smallest primary planet mercury is so much smaller than the other planets tiny little a little baby mercury it's the smallest planet of the primary planet so if you think a small planet think of mercury it's small it's hot you wouldn't want to live there the next planet planet 2 is venus venus is right here it's the second planet from the sun now this is interesting venus is called earth's twin the reason for that is they are very similar size they're almost the same size and what's interesting they're both rocky planets just like mercury is and earth and venus are made of similar rocks so they're pretty much the same size very similar size and they're made of the same stuff it's almost like the earth and the planet venus are twins hey did you know every day on venus is a cloudy day and the clouds are yellow oh that's such a gross color for clouds clouds are much better when there are other colors than yellow so the sunlight doesn't actually hit the surface of venus it's just a cloudy day every day forever but that's okay because there's no life on venus so nobody's crying about it and this is cool venus is the closest planet to earth [Music] it is the easiest planet to see in the sky you don't even need a telescope how cool is that [Music] the third planet is well ours the earth the earth is the third planet here's where the earth is yep it's the third planet from the sun by the way these planets never line up like this we just have it like this so you can see the order of the planets but they're normally very very jumbled they don't line up like this just wanted to share that but the earth is the third planet from the sun here's a picture of the ocean and some seagulls that are in some of the shallow parts of the water it's interesting earth is the only planet we know of that has oceans and life on it earth is one of the rocky planets yeah we live on a massive rock that has oceans that has life i mean that's absolutely incredible remember four of the planets are rocky planets earth has one moon the moon orbits the earth like the earth orbits the sun wow there's our planet that's where we live the earth the fourth planet is mars mars is right here in between earth and jupiter what color is mars look at mars what color is that yeah it's kind of like a reddish orange because of its color mars is called the red planet so if anyone asks you what's the red planet tell them hey the red planet is mars even though it is red it is not hot it is much colder than earth because remember mars is further from the sun than the earth so mars it's red it almost looks like it would be hot but it's cold [Music] hey is there life on mars it's a really good question that a lot of scientists have been trying to answer for a long time well scientists believe there used to be water on mars if there was water there may have been life and even stranger there are some scientists that believe we may still find basic forms of life still living on mars mars is the fourth rocky planet remember we said there are only four rocky planets so it's the last of the rocky planets mars has volcanoes and valleys just like earth they're just sometimes much bigger in fact there's a volcano on mars that's as big as the state of texas wow huge and this is kind of cool mars has two moons they are both very small okay there's small moons which is good you know mars has a couple moons it's nice we've got a moon mars has two moons you know mars is the fourth planet from the sun and it's in between the earth and jupiter the fifth planet is jupiter jupiter the first of the gas planets here is where jupiter is it's the massive planet between mars and saturn i mean jupiter is huge it's the biggest planet in our solar system in fact all of the other planets could fit in jupiter and there would be extra room all of the other planets could fit inside of jupiter that's how big jupiter is and this is amazing jupiter has at least 63 moons and we say at least because they're still discovering more wow and because jupiter is a gas planet if you ever visited it you would just fall right through just kidding you would float i mean you they wouldn't fall the gravity wouldn't be there you would just kind of float around and you know jupiter is the giant gas planet in between mars and saturn the sixth planet is saturn another gas planet here is saturn the sixth planet from the sun you could spot it easily because of those huge rings and it's in between jupiter and uranus hey did you know saturn's rings are made of ice oh my goodness how cool that must be icy rings those rings are made of ice wow like jupiter saturn has a lot of moons saturn has 62 moons wow tons and tons of moons what's up with jupiter and saturn right [Music] and this is pretty awesome saturn is the farthest planet you can see without a telescope that's right you can see saturn with your own eyes without a telescope look mommy and daddy i see shading with my own eyes she sat on my shoes and everything saturn is a gas planet that's the sixth planet from the sun and is in between jupiter and uranus the seventh planet is uranus another gas planet uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is in between saturn and neptune both uranus and neptune are the only planets you can't see without a telescope so it took a while for them to be discovered now this is neat william herschel discovered uranus in 1781 it took us a long time to finally find the planet uranus uranus is a gas planet that is made of gas and liquid what's cool is uranus has rings just like saturn has rings scientists believe the rings of uranus could be pieces of broken moons we don't know for sure but that's really fascinating if that's the case speaking of moons uranus has 27 moons 27 moons i mean we just have one you know 27. uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and is in between saturn and neptune the eighth and final planet is neptune hey that means the first four planets are rocky planets and the last four planets are gas planets so here is where neptune is it's the furthest planet from the sun like uranus neptune is a gas planet that is also made of liquid neptune was discovered in 1846 when uranus was being studied they're like wait a second there's a whole other planet here on the end let's call it neptune neptune is known for its storms the worst storms in the solar system in fact winds reach over 1 000 miles per hour on neptune that's pretty intense neptune has 14 known moons but scientists believe there may be more here's neptune the furthest planet from the sun you have done such an amazing job with us today today we learned planets are round objects that orbit the sun the word orbit means to circle around basically the planets are round objects that go around the sun we learn there are two types of planets primary planets and there are eight primary planets and dwarf planets there are five dwarf planets and here are all eight primary planets their familiar friends now mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune the first four planets are rocky planets mercury venus earth and mars are rocky planets the four planets furthest from the sun are the gas planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune are gas planets wow that's the end of the stream you know if you want to check out our other videos you can but the stream is done you know you know a little bit a little bit droopy a little bit sad but it's okay the fun doesn't have to stop here you can keep learning you know but the stream is done this stream is done you know oh okay
