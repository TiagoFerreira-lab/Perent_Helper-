[Music] smile and learn five things you should know about pre-history [Music] pre-history marks the oldest period in the history of humanity it begins with the appearance of human beings and ends with the invention of writing this period started five million years ago yes you heard right it was ages ago it's called pre-history because it refers to the time before history meaning before the invention of writing [Music] according to the theory of evolution modern humans meaning us evolved from a certain group of primates who were able to stand upright on their legs their brain grew in size and this allowed them to be able to think did you know that the first humans lived in Africa we divide pre-history in three periods the Paleolithic the Neolithic and the age of medals the Paleolithic period humans were Nomads meaning they didn't settle in the same place they traveled from one area to another looking for a location to fish hunt or collect food Yes you heard right they were hunters and collectors among their favorite foods were wild berries deer Bisons or even mammoths they lived in tribes dwelling Huts or natural caves that they decorated with their well-known cave painting they represented hunting scenes like the one you can see in this picture isn't it incredible that their art Still Remains to this day fire was discovered in Paleolithic times and humans made their first stone tools this is where the word comes from Paleolithic means Old Stone Those first men were progressing and perfecting their tools this is how the Neolithic period was initiated the word Neolithic means New Stone Neolithic times began ten thousand years ago Neolithic times began with the practice of Agriculture and cattle raising during this time human beings started domesticating animals and cultivating the land to grow food for this reason they stopped being Nomads and their lifestyle became sedentary they didn't have to travel to look for food they had everything they needed in their Villages Neolithic times are marked by the first settlements found near fertile land where there was plenty of water they needed water for their animals and crops cattle raising and cultivating the land improved their diet that's why population started to grow during this time an important Discovery came about the wheel it made things easier for agriculture the invention of other extraordinary things like the sale the loom the plow or Pottery also took place human beings continued progressing and they started using weapons and metal tools this is the moment Neolithic times end and the age of medals begins [Music] the age of medals was a revolutionary time because metal tools were more wear resistant than stone tools these new gadgets allowed men to hunt and cultivate the land more easily this Improvement in farming and agriculture resulted in having more food that's why population increased metals like copper bronze iron or even gold were discovered during this time craftsmanship and transportation improved a lot this gave rise to Commerce and the trading of products this system is known as barter pre-history ended with the invention of writing is a fascinating period don't you think so these are the five things you should know about pre-history did you like learning about them five things you should know about the Paleolithic the Paleolithic is the first period of pre-history it's also the longest period of time in history it begins with the appearance of human beings around 300 000 years ago in Africa Paleolithic means Old Stone and this explains the appearance of the first stone tools during Paleolithic times humans lived in tribes small settlements of 20 or 30 people dwelling Huts or natural caves foreign s meaning they didn't settle in the same place they traveled from one area to another looking for a location to fish hunt or collect food in other words they were hunters and collectors among their favorite foods were wild berries deer bisons or even mammoths during Paleolithic times people held rituals to worship nature and ask for food abundance that's right they prayed to the sun and the rain another interesting aspect of their culture is that they buried their Dead performing funeral rituals wow it sounds like the earliest evidence of spiritual beliefs fire was discovered in Paleolithic times no that's not what I meant it seems that the lightning from a thunderstorm accidentally started the first fire later on men learned to make fire in two different ways rubbing a stick against a tree trunk or two stones together fire was very important because it kept the people in the tribe warm during the night or in the winter time also thanks to the discovery of fire they could now cook their food and enjoy eating tastier things [Music] art in Paleolithic times began 35 000 years ago I'm sure you'll probably be wondering was there such thing as a primitive Museum not really the first cave paintings were made on the walls and ceilings of the caves they lived in cave art was meant to decorate they liked living in beautiful homes their paintings represented hunting scenes like the one you can see in this picture isn't it incredible that their art Still Remains to this day to make the paints they use soil blood and plants they painted using their fingers or paint brushes [Music] the first stone tools were made during the Paleolithic times these tools were key to surviving because they made hunting and fishing easier and more effective this was great because they could get more food to make these tools they shaped Stones using another Stone some of the first primitive tools were knives or arrowheads as they were progressing they started using materials like bones or wood to make needles or even harpoons these first men continued progressing becoming more and more intelligent and improving their lifestyle the practice of Agriculture and cattle raising marked the end of the Paleolithic times and the beginning of Neolithic times these are the five things you should know about the Paleolithic times did you like learning about them [Music] five things you should know about Neolithic times prehistory is divided into two major stages the Stone Age and the age of metals the Neolithic period is the last stage of the Stone Age Neolithic times began with the practice of Agriculture and cattle raising the word Neolithic means New Stone and this explains why the stone tools that appeared during this period were much more elaborate than Paleolithic tools the beginning of Neolithic times is marked by the practice of Agriculture and cattle raising during this stage humans started to domesticate animals like goats sheep and cows these first farm animals were kept for their meat milk and skin during Neolithic times people started to cultivate the land to grow food planting cereal like wheat or barley for this reason they stopped being Nomads and their lifestyle became sedentary they didn't have to travel to look for food they had everything they needed in their villages Neolithic times are marked by the first settlements found near fertile land where there was plenty of water they needed water for their animals and crops cattle raising and cultivating the land improved their diet that's why populations started to grow small villages were growing bigger and bigger and this brought in new ways of social organization tribal chiefs were responsible for the safety of the village and the well-being of the people the first man-made stone tools appeared in Paleolithic times becoming more elaborate during Neolithic times the main difference was that these tools were no longer made by striking two stones together they were made by friction polishing meaning they were sharper and more durable it was now easier to hunt and cultivate the land more effectively Neolithic people invented the plow in the sickle which they used for plowing and harvesting their crops one of the most important tools was the hand Mill it was used during the Neolithic times to grind grains [Music] during this stage a very important tool was invented the wheel that made agricultural tasks much easier this invention is equally important in modern times as well as it is impossible to imagine life without it don't you think so other significant inventions took place as well like the loom which Neolithic people used for weaving clothes and tapestry thanks to this invention they also managed to make the first sales which helped them to navigate the Seas using the force of the Wind Neolithic people are also known for discovering pottery and making ceramics the first megalithic structures appeared as well they are thought to have been used as burial and worship sites Villages were growing bigger and bigger and people started using metal tools in their everyday tasks the use of metal tools marks the end of the Neolithic period and the beginning of the age of medals a new stage in prehistory these are the five things you should know about this time period did you like learning about them foreign things you should know about the age of medals pre-history is divided into two major stages the Stone Age and the age of medals that began seven thousand years ago when humans started making metal objects the age of medals was a true milestone in human history because metal tools were far more durable than stone tools these new gadgets allowed men to hunt and cultivate the land more easily this Improvement in farming and agriculture resulted in having more food that's why population increased the age of medals is divided into the copper age the Bronze Age and the Iron Age during the age of medals early settlements and Villages started to grow and slowly gave rise to the cities these cities were normally located in areas with huge underground metal resources and they were surrounded by high walls to protect them from enemies houses were made of stone or adobe a mixture of mud and hay these cities marked the beginnings of great civilizations in ancient history this period in history is also marked by something of great significance the first jobs and trades people were now focusing exclusively on working in one particular trade area like Commerce cattle raising agriculture Pottery or metal crafts metal was used as a raw material to make tools weapons or jewelry copper was the first metal people started to use but it wasn't wear resistant that's why they used it mainly to make jewelry and to a lesser degree for utensils and tools then people discovered bronze a very hard metal sharpened bronze was used in making very useful hunting weapons the last metal people discovered was Iron same as bronze iron was a very hard and wear resistant metal using both bronze and iron people made tools they used to work with also weapons and even sculptures to be able to mold Metals people melted them in ovens heating them up in very high temperatures molten liquid metal was poured into molds forming the desired shapes and creating different tools utensils and weapons this process is known as Metallurgy and took place during the age of metals nowadays Metallurgy is still considered to be one of the most important sectors in modern society thanks to Metallurgy the crafting trait started to bloom older inventions like the wheel or the sale were now being improved to give rise to the first means of transportation like the carriage for the first sailing boats thanks to them Commerce and the trading of goods started to develop cities were growing and people started changing their lifestyle the age of medals ends with the invention of writing this is when great ancient civilizations start emerging these are the five things you should know about the age of medals did you like learning about them five things you should know about ancient age I'm sure you've heard about the Pyramids of Giza but did you know that they actually were massive tombs for Pharaohs thousands of laborers worked for years to build a pyramid the inside of the pyramids is full of mysteries there are tunnels Chambers and secret shops or passageways the most important pyramids are those of shiops chefrin and mencore what about mummies do you know what they were when a pharaoh or a wealthy Egyptian died a body was prepared to be preserved for as long as possible the dead body was cleaned and covered with aromatic substances then it was wrapped in bandages later on the body was placed in luxurious sarcophaguses Egyptians believed in life after death that's why next to the dead body they would leave Furniture food and other objects they thought might be useful in the next life but wait hold on a second when did all of that take place the Egyptian civilization flourished in the Northeast region of the African continent in the place that is now the country of Egypt this civilization began more than 5 000 years ago and lasted about 3 000 years how impressive the Nile River was a key factor in the development of the Egyptian civilization the Nile is the second largest river in the world it is almost 7 000 kilometers long the Egyptian civilization flourished on its Riverbanks Egypt is mostly desert and a few fertile lands were along the river oh it wasn't just the Rich Harvest people also fished in the Nile apart from agriculture and fishing and Nile River was also important because it was used for transportation and shipping the ships carried people and goods throughout the empire [Music] I'm sure you've heard about pharaohs do you know who they were Pharaohs were the kings of ancient Egypt they were thought to be Gods on Earth Cleopatra was one of the most famous Queens she was also a diplomat Navy Commander linguist and wrote books on medicine another famous King was tooth in common his tomb was discovered almost intact did you know that King Tut became a pharaoh when he was nine years old [Music] these are the five things you should know about ancient Egypt did you like learning about them [Music] five things you should know about ancient Greece [Music] the ancient Greek civilization emerged around 1200 BC in a privileged Place between the Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea this territory was made up of a peninsula and a group of islands ancient Greeks were settlers they didn't just conform to staying in their territory they wanted to look for and colonize new lands to expand their civilization ancient Greeks were excellent Sailors and they reached many parts of the Mediterranean Sea extending their commercial activity and craftsmanship trade foreign Greeks called their cities police and each one of them had its own government police were very well organized there was an Agora in every one of them which was the main public place an acropolis which was the highest part of the police A theater where ancient Greeks held events like comedy or tragedy plays walls to defend the city and the Parthenon the temple where they worshiped their gods Sparta and Athens were two of the most famous and Powerful police there were occasional fights among the cities and these would then declare war in order to expand their territory and gain more power ancient Greek society was divided into two groups free citizens and non-citizens pre-citizens were men born in police and made the most important decisions non-citizens were the women the foreigners and the slaves who never enjoyed their fundamental rights ancient Greeks established a government regime called democracy that allowed only free citizens to make decisions by means of voting ancient Greeks were a polytheistic Society this means that they worshiped many gods have you ever heard of Ares the God of War how about Poseidon the sea God I'm sure you know that soos was the father of all the gods ancient Greek mythology emerged in this civilization it's a collection of stories and legends about gods and heroes ancient Greeks made up these stories to explain to people the origins of the world and transmit their values do you know the story of Hercules he was the son of Zeus a superhero half God half-human his powers were out of this world [Music] ancient Greeks were incredibly curious and took great interest in learning about everything around them be it nature or human beings themselves this is how the discipline of philosophy emerges a word that in Greek is translated as love of wisdom some of the most well-known philosophers were Plato or Aristotle there were also important mathematicians during this period like Pythagoras or Archimedes who intended to apply geometry principles in building and explain the meaning of numbers in people's everyday lives their interest for intelligence and knowledge helped the ancient Greek civilization expand around the Mediterranean Sea the Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece isn't it incredible they managed to survive till modern times in the old times the Olympic Games were held every four years in Olympia the best athletes who came from several different parts of Greece competed in the games they participated in sports like jumping disc throw or running back then athletes were competing for an olive wreath not for medals many of the ancient Olympic values like teamwork discipline and effort still remain up to this day the ancient Greek civilization came to an end in 146 BC but the ancient Greek Legacy is still present today in politics culture philosophy or even Sports [Music] these are the five things you should know about ancient Greece did you like learning about them [Music] five things you should know about the Roman Empire Rome was founded more than 2 800 years ago on the banks of the Tiber as several tribes came together in the land that is now the country of Italy Legend has it that the founders of Rome were two twin brothers Romulus and Remus who were raised by a wolf from the beginning Rome was a monarchy ruled by Kings later on the Romans established another government regime called The Republic there is no King in a republic so politicians were the ones who made all the decisions coming to agreements back then Rome was expanding and conquered a large part of Italy and the Mediterranean Sea centuries later the government of the Republic faced a crisis and a new era was initiated known as the Roman Empire all the power belonged to the Emperor who was counseled by the Senate foreign [Music] was a civilization of great significance in Antiquity that expanded through the territories surrounding the Mediterranean Sea from east to west Britannia Espana France Greece Northern Africa and Syria the Roman army was in charge of conquering new lands and keeping the peace within the empire the Roman army was made up of Legions and these were formed by thousands of soldiers called legionnaires their coat of arms was the eagle which I'm sure you've seen before legionnaires were very well trained and underwent military training the Romans were great at strategic thinking and managed to build a whole empire [Music] the Roman society was divided in several groups the patricians were the most powerful group they belonged to nobility and they were politicians or Soldiers the plebeians made up the working class or mob they were Craftsmen peasants and workers slaves had no rights at all and were considered to be property of the empire ancient Rome was a polytheistic Society this means that Romans worshiped many gods like Minerva for example who was the goddess of wisdom Neptune the sea god Mars the God of War or Venus the goddess of love Roman cities were walled and the streets were paved Romans were excellent at urban planning and architecture they built Bridges to be able to cross over rivers a road system to connect cities and the famous aqueducts to transport water they also created buildings like circuses or amphitheaters to Stage various forms of entertainment like Chariot racing or Gladiator fights but there was more to Roman entertainment than that they also built theaters where they represented events like plays from ancient Greece they built schools too to educate children [Music] towards the end of the 4th Century A.D neighboring Germanic tribes started to invade Roman territories this resulted in a huge crisis that divided the empire in two the Western Roman Empire whose capital was Rome and the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantium this way governing such a vast territory would be much easier the Eastern Roman Empire lasted until 1453 while the Western Roman Empire slowly dissolved until it disappeared in Fort 76. the Middle Ages started right after the fall of the Roman Empire thousands of years later the history of Rome is still present in the organization of our cities politics culture or art another very important contribution of the Romans was the Roman civil law system many of their laws and ways to understand Society still remain till now [Music] these are the five things you should know about the Roman Empire did you like learning about them [Music] five things you should know about the Middle Ages [Music] the Middle Ages were a very long period of time in history mind you no less than 10 centuries it began with the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 A.D and ended with the discovery of America in 1492 A.D the end of the Middle Ages is also related to the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the invention of the printing press after the fall the Roman Empire in the 5th Century Europe was divided in many territories the majority of them were denominated by territorial monarchies a ruling system where Kings had come to power meaning they were the ones that ruled thank you during the Middle Ages Society was based around the feudal system do you know what feudal system means picture pyramid its top part would be the king who like we said before had the power and ruled over the land with clerical consent right below the king and the clergy were the Nobles they ruled over the lands allocated to them by the king in exchange for swearing Allegiance and defending the country during Warfare Nobles had authority over peasants and vassals known as serfs who worked the land and live there they worked for protection in exchange peasants paid high taxes to their Lords [Music] foreign as we said before the Middle Ages lasted more than 1 000 years that's why we divide this period in two phases the Early Middle Ages from the 5th to the 10th century and the late Middle Ages from the 11th to the 15th century what's the difference about each phase during the Early Middle Ages the nobility and the clergy had a lot of power in contrast during the late Middle Ages the monarchy takes power back during the Middle Ages Agricultural and cattle racing were solely a means of substance that is to say to feed the People by contrast during the late Middle Ages there's an increase in production in commercial activity while in the Early Middle Ages people lived on thieves during the late Middle Ages there's a Resurgence of the cities that become the new economic centers [Music] during the Middle Ages Warfare was very common the importance of nights derives from this fact as they played a key role defending their King and Nobles Knights were taught fighting skills and were trained with all sorts of weapons they wore a heavy armor and a helmet which protected them many Knights were members of the Gentry apart from Warfare Knights also participated in tournaments and jousts risking their reputation and prestige have you ever seen a medieval castle castles where fortified structures typically built in the Middle Ages they were situated on high ground which made defending the territory much easier as you could see far into the distance castles were usually protected by defensive walls and sometimes there was a moat surrounding them the king and the noble men lived in the castle medieval markets were just the place to buy food grain spices Fabrics or jewelry peasants sold their farming products and cattle while Artisans sold handmade objects in the Middle Ages Artisans of the same trade formed associations called craft guilds for example the blacksmith's Guild the bread Baker's Guild or the Stone Cutters Guild [Music] these are the five things you should know about the Middle Ages did you like learning about them five things you should know about the Industrial Revolution [Music] the Industrial Revolution began in England in the 18th century thanks to James Watts steam engine the engine transformed water vapor thermal energy to mechanical energy this invention revolutionized Society like never before the steam engine was mainly used in transportation and factories the use of the steam engine changed object manufacturing completely these objects previously made in small workshops were now produced in big factories for this reason small workshops practically disappeared thanks to the new Industries supply chain products were much cheaper to make and more affordable to buy this helped the economy to prosper steam engines were also used in transportation trade Commerce and also long-distance traveling became easier freight trains could transport heavy cargo at a speed that was too high for that time almost 40 kilometers per hour not that fast right well back then that was really fast steamships were a breakthrough as well because For the first time in history navigating wouldn't have to depend on or be interrupted by weather conditions [Music] traditional rural living way of life and the countryside owned by the aristocracy lose their importance during the Industrial Revolution an urban class emerges the bourgeoisie these were the factory owners who had become very rich peasants were now forming the so-called proletariat wage earners who worked in the factories for very little money they were really poor and their working conditions were Dreadful but as centuries went by workers started trade unions and worker associations that helped them to improve their situation [Music] in 1837 Samuel Morris invented the telegraph in Boston this device enabled people to communicate over long distances in addition Morris created a code in which letters were represented by sound signals nowadays known as the morse code the first Telegraph message from Washington DC to Baltimore was sent seven years later both cities were just 60 kilometers apart a few years after that Telegraph Lions connected the continents of America and Europe [Music] these are
