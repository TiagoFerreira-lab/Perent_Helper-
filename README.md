# PocketWisdom AI – YouTube-Powered Educational Assistant


## Project Overview
PocketWisdom AI is a RAG-powered educational chatbot that helps parents explain school topics to their children in fun, kid-friendly language. It retrieves knowledge from YouTube transcripts, finds relevant diagrams, and presents simplified educational responses — all driven by GPT-4o-mini.

This project was developed as part of the Ironhack final capstone and uses LangChain, LangSmith, and vector search to build a truly helpful educational assistant.

## Features
Agent-Powered Tool Usage:

🧾 Document Search: Retrieves relevant YouTube transcript chunks

🔢 Calculator: Performs step-by-step numeric reasoning

🖼️ Image Search: Auto-fetches diagrams or visuals related to the topic (no fallbacks used)

GPT-4o-mini: Fast, accurate, and cost-effective reasoning and explanation

LangSmith Evaluation: Validates output accuracy, hallucination, and relevance

Streamlit App: Friendly local interface for natural language chat

## Evaluation Metrics (via LangSmith)
rag-answer-vs-reference	  - Compares the AI answer to a reference answer for factual correctness
rag-answer-hallucination	- Checks if the AI answer is grounded in the retrieved documents
rag-document-relevance	  - Verifies that the retrieved documents are relevant to the question
